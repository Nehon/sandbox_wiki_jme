== Blendswap Arcade Game Contest

The Blendswap Arcade contest is a game making contest where all entries must use the same scene from Blendswap. All participants have a week to create their game. It is currently planned to be a monthly contest.


== Rules

The rules are:

....
  You may use or even make other assets, but;
      You may NOT extend the confines of the game level.
  You may use any existing open source code, including your own.
  The scene does not in any way dictate the gameplay.
  The game must be completely open source and made freely available through a code repository like GitHub upon completion.
  Game submission must be an executable, preferably fully functional on all PC platforms.
....

Game entries are judged on:

....
  Utilization – Appropriate & innovative use of the scene.
  Completion – Completeness of the game: Keep it simple!
....
