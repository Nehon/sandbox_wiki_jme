=== Ideas

*Question*: Why not a general Entity framework?

*Answer*: You've told somewhere else that an Entity framework can compose up every thing… Yeah, quite. But for RPG, more specificly, for the idea phase, same with software modeling phase in game ( means when character concept, design, voice acting, dialoge, scripts…are made), it's not really appropriated! 
'''

*Question*: So you telling about the gaps?

*Answer*: Yes, you know, thoose guys (script writer) not really need to know any technical things. They just like to made up stuffs. That's why after write down thoose ideas, this framework change the resulted data into programming materials (code, config, 3d models…). Consider this a bridge from game designers to coder, and the script writer to the teams.
'''

*Question*: What so Next-gen about it?

*Answer*: Yeah, not so much. The idea at first is humble, but it will leverage so much your company's productivity. In fact, big team and big company use home grown tools to archive their scripts and ideas,intelectual properties. That's how their do it, if you know yet!
