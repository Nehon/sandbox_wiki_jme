== Comparisons between 3D game/simulation dev framework

3D game/simulation dev frameworks


=== Java GameEngines

Some of them are free and open sourced but limited in features compared to JME3 and Atom together. In fact one can learn the architecture of Atom and plug in their engines. It's not too hard to do so as I did go through that path. The problem is the architecture is very hard to built from different concepts and loads of researches I did in the past 6 years. :)) But yes, they can of course.

==== Others

Some of them are free for non-commercial usages. But they're not opensourced and also just a â€œgame engine with a lot of limitation because of this closed model. Other technologies are slowly get into their supports (and even their mind set). In my POV, those limitation's not acceptable for a rapid changing world like we living in.

==== Conclusion

Atom and JME3 are young but the vision is clear. We want to build next gen game engine for every one with the lastest technologies!
