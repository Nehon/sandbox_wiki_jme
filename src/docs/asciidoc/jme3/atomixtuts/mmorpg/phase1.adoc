== PHASE 1

*HI, WELCOME AGAIN !*

Glad that we made it through a month already. In fact I don't have much time to work on this project but it's still under control. 

Most important, we've had the base working with a three layers architecture of Server Client and Common which are know minimum amount of each other, beside of achieved other design goalsâ€¦ It's also good enough to be a Proof of concept at this point.. In conclusion, what we achieved in Phase Zero is a stable software design, gameplay and some WIP assets, and last but not least the Taste of an MMO. :p Nice!

Now we're going to move to the Phase 1.
