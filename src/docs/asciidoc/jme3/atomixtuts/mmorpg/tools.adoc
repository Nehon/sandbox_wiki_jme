== THE TOOLS

The most amazing part of this MMORPG journey is: we have a lot of Editors for every aspect of the game. 


[NOTE]
====
I came from UDK and then Unity so I borrows a lot of their editors ideas.
====


They are not 100% complete, but will soon be in Beta status in August, as I bring the tools to the National Software Contest of my country, Vietnam. They’re almost workable but I want to integrate them as plugins of JME SDK, so they need further development, here are their status:


=== Addition to SDK


==== Extra plugins to the SDK core

*  - New Project type, support DB, Entity data, and Web-scale in first place.
