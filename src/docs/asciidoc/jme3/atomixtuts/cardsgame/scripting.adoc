== CardsGame: Scripting


=== Rule

In this game, Rule are implemented with groovy script


=== EffectText

In this game, Card's Effect are implemented with groovy script. You can procedure the script 2 two ways:

.  parse from original EffectText ripped from the internet, via OpenNLP
.  Write it your self with the help of the Editor


[TIP]
====
For the help in OpenNLP go AdvancedTechique section

==== Small Card Editor

I always make a small in-house editor for every of my small games (before I integrate it into the SDK for larger project with tedious tasks with standardlized-professional workflow).
