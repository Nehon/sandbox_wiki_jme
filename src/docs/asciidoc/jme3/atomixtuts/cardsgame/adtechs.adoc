== ADVANCED TECHNIQUES

It seems like this example project just lead you through the most basic things you can do with JME3, but… It’s not totally true. I also want to show some advanced-cool techniques in which developers and artists can find helpful in their other projects. Those are:

*  Web harvest
*  Groovy data/config scripting
*  Groovy to make an in-house cards editor
*  OpenNLP to process EffectText of the orginal card
*  ANTRL to build an DSL language suite to descible effect chain

But I will not go too much into detail of the underlying techniques here but the detail implementation at my side for this game!

Anyway, these advanced-cool techniques is still pretty specific to this game, so I bring it to another section to help you focus in the main parts in the first tutorial. If you still interest read futher :p


=== Web harvest

It comes the time in the project when you want to find a lot of references. Or, even want to find information which you know already been somewhere on the internet. Yeah! Me too. At that time, I meet Web harvest, one of the most useful tool that I use from time to time and also try my best to master it!!

If you got time just read a little bit about it to get the basic idea of what it is and what it for. In this project I want to make data by combining things from the internet for the Card game… Dont call me pirate even if I’m truly one. I use some source in the internet to harvest the information in the Yugioh Card and Packs, like description, attack, defend point…etc. and save it in to… Groovy script.


[TIP]
====
You can take a look at my webhavest configuration file here , but use them as your own risk against the law :p!

=== Groovy data scripting

It comes the time when you don’t want to use XML and all other things to make config and text data file, cause you just love the short and briliant syntax of Groovy. Me too… again!

In Atom framework, I used Groovy to make game configuration, dialogue, cinematic scripting, facial scripting, AI scripting and even a whole GAME! That’s why I also use Groovy to save the infomations of the cards. Lucky me, Web harvest also can play with groovy like a charm, so benefit.

Detailed technique should be shown in an “in-deep” topic, here I just show a few pictures what I’ve done with this two techs for this card game: :woot: :woot:

=== GroovyEditor

Before you start . Go <<jme3/advanced/scripting#,scripting>>


=== OpenNLP


==== OpenNLP introduction

OpenNLP is …


==== How it help?


=== ANTRL


==== ANTRL introduction

ANTRL is….


==== How it help?

In fact, Groovy also provide DSL mechanisim . So in the first …

But , ANTRL have better Java integration so ..
