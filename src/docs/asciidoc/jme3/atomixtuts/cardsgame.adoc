== CARD GAME

*Hi Monkeys,*

This is the first Chapter of the Game making tutorial series and named “The card game”.

My intention is to make a “clone” Card game as Yugi Oh card game (similar to Collectable Magic Cards game).


[IMPORTANT]
====
emoji: Question: Why “clone”??? emoji: +
Answer: To skip the concept and idea phase, <<jme3/atomixtuts/cardsgame#Why_clone?, More about Concept and Game Design...>>
====



== INTRODUCTION


=== Basic idea:

Clone Yugioh – the card game. In the game, two players use magic card with attack and defend to play with each other

Short : <<jme3/atomixtuts/cardsgame/gameplay#,gameplay>>

Detailed game rule can be viewed here: link:http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Master_Rules[http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Master_Rules]


=== Why clone?

In fact, the idea and game design phase is very important for game industry! emoji:confused

*But because audiences can also be newbie and non-pro, for them, this process are NOT necessary a MUST  emoji:wink!!!! *

Because of this gameplay and also the games -Yugi Cards and Collectiable Magic Cards are pretty popular, I decided to skip Game Design and Concept phase,  hoping you guys already know what the game should look like and play like. ! I will also to Asset making videos but keep them short as possible.


=== Techniques shown

Skills will be used, GOOD things that you should CATCH:

.  Modeling| Import 3D, animations
.  Atom framework
.  Picking
.  Scripting with Groovy
.  Basic animation, effects


=== Advanced

Advanced features/potentials of the game:

.  AI, rule base
.  Web harvest for data
.  Tournament ( multiplayer)
.  *Script and advanced rule parsing (with ANTRL and OpenNLP) *

== FIRST RUN


=== STEP 1) Download and Setup:

Full complete project download: Download from SVN
Starter project (with assets) download: Download from SVN


==== STEP 2) Atom framework:

<<jme3/advanced/atom_framework#, Atom Framework>>
Click to this topic to learn how to setup Atom, AtomAI, Groovy and stuffs…


==== STEP 3) First run:

Copy the complete working code and run the game, enjoy it for a while!
Now go back and make another project with the base starter code.
After refactoring, you should have the game runing succesfully and just show up the main menu.


[TIP]
====
Atom framework documentation is here to read: <<jme3/advanced/atom_framework/docs#,docs>>
====



== Asset making

In asset making phase, we will make 3D Models of the card, table in Blender. With appropriate textures in PTS and Shader in JME3.

After that we will make| import a few very famous Card character model and skills to make the exceed the gameplay's fun!
<<jme3/atomixtuts/cardsgame/assets#, Detailed Assets Making process>>


== Programming


=== Java & Groovy

Now the prepare steps are almost complete, we start coding our game!


[IMPORTANT]
====
This will be a big but interesting challenge for who really want to start a serious game development career and even for who just want to learn how to do it.
====


Groovy syntax is very similar to java, in fact you can use all java syntax in groovy plus almost time, it’s much more shorter than writing code in a Java version.

I can present my self almost an artist (60% vs 40% of a programmer :p ).. So, i prefer doing cool stuffs instead of hard stuffs. That’s why i played with both Java and Groovy. In this section, from time to time, you will find how Groovy save your life with clean and bright syntax instead of verbose big bad Java here and there.
____

You can get started with groovy in just few hours here. I also will explain a little bit of Groovy in the way.

==== Setup Atom framework


[IMPORTANT]
====
Remember to download and install the Atom framework with the instruction above!
====



==== Detailed Implementation

Checklist of what we going to implementation in this tutorial:

*  GameStage and Gameplay
**  Card gameplay elements (Game, Turn, Phase,..)
**  GameWorld
**  Select/Picking
**  Start/pause
**  Save/load game states

*  Entities
**  Card
**  More

*  States
**  Menu
**  InGame
**  Loading

*  Managers
**  StageManager
**  GUIManager
**  GamePlayManager

*  Controls

== Scripting


[TIP]
====
For more JME3 Scripting <<jme3/scripting#,scripting>>
====

In this game, Groovy script will envolved in:

*  Rule
*  EffectText
*  In-house card editor

More insights,
Rule are implemented with groovy script
Card's Effect are implemented with groovy script. You can procedure the script 2 two ways:

.  parse from original EffectText ripped from the internet, via OpenNLP
.  Write it your self with the help of the Editor

I always make a small in-house editor for every of my small games (before I integrate it into the SDK for larger project with tedious tasks with standardlized-professional workflow).

== AI

AI (aka Artifact Intelligent):

In this section I want to introduce the AtomAI library. It named after Atom project but in fact it’s just a bunch of wrapper for existed contributed and open-source libraries in various aspects of AI area: FSM, Behavior Tree, Decision Tree, Learning machine…


[IMPORTANT]
====
In the source code the dependencies in AtomAI is removed. Just the class that this game used are kept!
====


Futher more, I added a lot of +++<abbr title="Graphical User Interface">GUI</abbr>+++ tools to deal with creating and combining sophisticated AI.

....
  For this Magic cardgame, I only use two simplest AI technique : Behavior/Decision Tree and Minimax, as simple as shorter than 500 lines of code. But the resulted Card AI can play with human newbie opponent and even can win sometimes. Our implementation in java or groovy already have Data Model supported by AtomAI library.
....

Detailed AI implementation <<jme3/atomixtuts/cardsgame/ai#,ai>>


== Advanced techniques


[IMPORTANT]
====
You generally dont want to go too deep in your first tutorial! :p So consider reading further than this. Those below techs are tied specificly to this game and also my very personal experiences!
====


*  Use Webharvest to collect useful data for your game.
*  And Groovy to config instead of XML or plain-text
*  Groovy to make an in-house cards editor
*  OpenNLP to process EffectText of the orginal card
*  ANTRL to build an DSL language suite to descible effect chain

Detailed introduction <<jme3/atomixtuts/cardsgame/adtechs#,adtechs>>


== Conclusion

After a few thousands LoC game, I hope you guys find something useful to start working with our powerful engine JME3. In this first tutorial, I don’t want to go too much and too soon into technical problems. That’s not the way to go! ;-P

....
  In the next tutorial of the series, you will go straight in a bigger challenge with I think will give you more inspirations: “A Medieval RPG game” -  with story telling and cinematic. That’s it, a real game template which you can expand to make a full blown game.
....


[TIP]
====
Next tutorial: A Medieval RPG game - <<jme3/atomixtuts/bladegame#, Blade of the Immortals>>
====

But that’s enough for this month. I planed to stop a little bit to listen to feedbacks from you guys in how i can improve the tutorials or what I should go more into detail.

Big Thanks,

Atomix
