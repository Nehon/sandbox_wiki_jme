basic ideas, some terms, techniques,idioms, workflows you should learn and practice in the way of game/software developing.

I will keep it short but concise!

==== Thing to keep near

.  Papers &amp; Pencils
.  Your search engine

.  2D Concept
..  Outline: sketch first, dicuss a lot about ideas, be wild
..  Coloring: get as much of details as you can

.  3D Modeling
..  Draft: T-Pose, Simple geometry, basic lighting
..  Detail: with clean up textures, maps, shaders, better scuplting, animation

Be wild!

===== As Indie & As one man army

If you never in a professinal workflow before, try to do it simplier as your only have limited man power. Most valuable advice if you’re an artist do programming: Do it like Zen :p

.  Smart and active: Research first, try to call out for help if need! Opensource are the key.
..  Flexible but manageable: Try to use SVN.
..  Shoot with both hands: Do both assets and programming can cause a mesh, do one at a time. After finish review, get approved by yourself or the leader. Continue developing.
..  Pirate spirit: Use place holder as much as your can. Skip concept, may use existed assets. There are plenty of free assets.
..  Avoid premature optimization: If still concerning about design, make it work first. When doubt lelf out.

== Management tips


=== Time constraints

With any workflow and model your team choose, keep in mind this to get high quality artworks in short limit of time, keep phase (a duration of development) tight, as my personal experiences:

.  *Concept phase* The more the better researches and ideas in short/afforable time!
.  *Design phase* The detailed the better/look ahead solutions and architecture in rather long time.
.  *Implementaion phase* The focus, intensive and “make it work first time.
.  *Review phase* Reviews and test, fix , always take long time, but do it frequently or you are doomed!!!


==== Phases and its expected result

So, in the end of each phase, you want to estimate your objectives and performane successes with a simple test/checklist . Here is “common expected result:

*Concept phase*  Ideas → Gameplay

*Design phase*   Gameplay → Screens

*Implementation phase*  Screen → States [or other paradigms] → Codes (class,config)

*Review phase*  Runs → Bugs → Patches → Deployed publishabe packages, game.


==== Design as first step!

In this phase, we will design the most important things have influence to our game:

*  Gameplay
*  Screens

Consider, gameplay brief texts is the initial basic “outline, and the screens are the detailed sketches of the gameplay into a “software form (that's it, a game :p).


[TIP]
====
Keep in mind, at first attempt don't waste your time to other paradigms than List(Table), States (simplest form of Graph) and Tree!!
====



==== In the scale of whole project

This article talking about pre-production and other durations

== Useful terms


=== Gameplay

A list of “names or “things will be seen in our game, bricks that build up the gameplay piece by piece.


==== As shortlist

Yeah, a real text list of names, short description and notes!

For examples, in a Football Manager game, as my EuroKick game <<jme3/atomixtuts/kickgame#,kickgame>>
You can see them as things:

* a Football fan see a football match in a stadium*.

or

*a business man see a company with finance, reports and statistics*.


===== As Mindmapping

In mind mapping, the links between the names represent various kind relationships such as “Has - “Belong to , “In category… or unknown as they just poped out of our mind.


[TIP]
====
In my POV, Mind mapping is really good for game design very first attempt!
====



[TIP]
====
Mind map can be consider very simple and basic ideas of the game in Graph based presentation, simplest Game Design document… Go to Text2Mindmap.com link:http://www.text2mindmap.com/[http://www.text2mindmap.com/] and build one… !

==== Design to Programming translation

Those, in turn will be implemented in programming language with a programming manner.

OOP for specific, appropriate name should be transfer to a appropriate Class of Object, with properties and methods.

For Component Oriented Programming (COP), names should be interpreted as Prefab with a specific set of components, and their processors.
