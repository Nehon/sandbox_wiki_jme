== EuroKick : Assets Making


=== 3D Models & Textures


==== Player

A very basic model with Run|Kick animation to test the gameplay.
Later we will improve the quality and make it customizable.
Uniform Cloth Texture layout is the same with Pro Soccer evolution and Fifa series.

==== Audiences

At first attempt, I model the audiences in the stadium with 2D sprites. So they are flat animated billboard always face the camera. For the beginning, this method is good enough. We will change to advanced method later.
