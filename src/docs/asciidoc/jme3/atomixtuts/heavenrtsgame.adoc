== PROCESS


== Researches


[TIP]
====
So, what is the point of doing quite amount of researches before into real game developing. Ehr… RTS is a hard topic, especially, thousands of game in this genre got published, with failures and successes. If we want to go beyond “making a game like Starcraft goal, we have to do those long term researches.
====


RTS games are my fav game genre.. I lost thousands of hours in them and never regret :p . That's why I try to make one, at least one like Star craft broodwar.

Long and Detailed research topic and links for you to read into:
