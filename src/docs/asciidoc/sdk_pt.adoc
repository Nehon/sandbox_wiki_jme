== Por quê jMonkeyEngine SDK?


image::sdk/jme3-jmonkeyplatform.png[jme3-jmonkeyplatform.png,width="288",height="180",align="left"]

O jMonkeyEngine SDK (_kit_ de desenvolvimento de software) é o ambiente de desenvolvimento de jogos recomendado para a biblioteca jMonkeyEngine 3.

O jMonkeyEngine SDK é um ambiente de desenvolvimento integrado (Integrated Development Environment - IDE) que lhe provê plugins únicos para a criação de conteúdo de jogos jMonkeyEngine 3. Você pode link:https://github.com/jMonkeyEngine/sdk/releases/tag/stable[baixar e instalar o jMonkeyEngine SDK] como um ambiente de desenvolvimento de jogos completo e pronto para o uso, ao invés de utilizar uma IDE Java genérica. (<<jme3/beginner/what_s_an_ide#,O que é uma IDE>>?)

* EM CONSTRUÇÃO *

Since the jMonkeyEngine SDK is based on the link:http://platform.netbeans.org/[NetBeans Platform] (<<sdk/whynoteclipse#,Why not Eclipse RCP?>>), you have access to all of the developer tools in the link:http://www.netbeans.org/[NetBeans IDE], including a wide variety of deployment formats ranging from browser Applet and WebStart to desktop executables. Allthough we recommend the jMonkeyEngine SDK, experienced users can work with the jMonkeyEngine JARs in their favorite IDE, and choose to only use the jMonkeyEngine SDK to manage assets and JME3 binaries.


[TIP]
====
Go to `Settings → Keymap` and choose your favorite keyboard profile: NetBeans default, Eclipse, IntelliJ, or others.

== A Little Bit of History

The jMonkeyEngine SDK first set root during a link:http://www.jmonkeyengine.com/forum/index.php?topic=13070.0[discussion by Normen]. Although preceded by previous similar projects, this was the first, serious attempt with the core team's blessing. For some time the project was referred to merely as the “link:http://blogs.sun.com/geertjan/entry/youtube_movie_of_jmonkeyengine_on[Game Development Environment], or “GDE for short. During alpha, we refered to it as link:http://www.jmonkeyengine.com/forum/index.php?topic=13510.0[jMonkeyPlatform], and for beta it was eventually named jMonkeyEngine SDK.
